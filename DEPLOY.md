# Deploy Your Site to GitHub Pages

Your code is already on GitHub! Now enable GitHub Pages to make it publicly accessible.

## Quick Setup (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to your repository settings:**
   ```
   https://github.com/hyperalz/AI_Governance/settings/pages
   ```

2. **Under "Source":**
   - Select **Branch**: `main`
   - Select **Folder**: `/ (root)`
   - Click **Save**

3. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for GitHub to build and deploy your site

### Step 2: Access Your Live Site

Once deployed, your site will be available at:
```
https://hyperalz.github.io/AI_Governance/
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

- Check the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repo to see the build status
- Look for a green checkmark when deployment is complete
- Visit the URL above to see your live site

## What's Live on Your Site

✅ **Hero Section** - Urgent, conversion-focused messaging  
✅ **Tiered Pricing** - 3 tiers ($197, $997, Coming Soon)  
✅ **Interactive Demo** - "Run Demo" button with animated terminal  
✅ **Product Showcase** - Complete toolkit overview  
✅ **Enhanced CTAs** - "Get Free Risk Assessment" with incentives  
✅ **All Documentation** - Scripts, templates, and guides  

## Troubleshooting

**Site not loading?**
- Wait 2-3 minutes after enabling Pages
- Check the Actions tab for build errors
- Ensure `index.html` is in the root (✅ it is)

**Changes not showing?**
- GitHub Pages may take a few minutes to update
- Hard refresh your browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check if commits were pushed successfully

## Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want a custom domain:
1. In Pages settings, add your custom domain
2. Update DNS records as instructed
3. Your site will be available at your custom domain
